# Source git for docker-py

This is a prototype of the source git concept. Utilizing an upstream git repository with downstream changes committed on top. The changes usually consists of

 * downstream packaging (spec file)
 * downstream configuration
 * downstream patches (=backports, these are usually merged upstream)

The master branch is left empty on purpose. The development is happening on other branches.
